1. https://github.com/Nova-Drive

2. 2.22.0

3. 2.28.1

4. Different versions of requests. Installed on my machine is 2.28.1 but with the python script it shows 2.22.0. On the venv it shows 2.28.1.

5. Code 301. To get the 200 response code you need to add www. To the URL. The correct command is curl -I GET http://www.google.com/

6. Both the same...? Fixes it by going to www.google.com/teapot
